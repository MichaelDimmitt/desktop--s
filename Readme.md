fixingDesktops is all about ... 

1) text files in every folder. 
2) text files store (x,y) location coordinates 
<br>procedurally generated.

upon right click for functionality, 
1) what is on current folder zips and goes to its respective folder.
2) file clicked is unloaded and becomes the new desktop setting.

## So what can this thing do today out of the box?
The mapping works for a mac ... completed a year ago.
<br>It just needs to be written into a textfile based on a directory it has knowledge of.

## So what needs to be built (mac)
zip and unzip functionality...
as well as assigning the files to their location on the desktop.

## Build steps
1) Seems zip functionality is the next easy place to start.
<br>Gotta clean that screen if we are going to load stuff.

2) load stuff.


##Coming Soon
<pre>
I want to run in a single program. 
The program needs to recognize whether on a mac or a pc. 

linux support will arrive at a later date.

once the correct operating system is found. 
apple script...
or powershell script ...

appropriately called.
